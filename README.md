# CS229/230 - Machine and Deep Learning

This repository is built for me to tackle the mathematical models and algorithm implementation in Python based on machine learning course CS229 and deep learning course cs230 from Univeristy of Stanford.

* [CS229: Syllabus](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html)

CS229 prepares you to be a machine learning specialist capable of developing ML algorithms. CS230 could transfer you to be an expert of deep learning models by knowing how to design the infrastructure of neural network models and train yoour models efficiently. Some people who don't have strong mathematical backgroup might find these two courses very challenging. Please, don't feel intimidated. I have typed almost all the mathematical derivations for each ML models, and put the source code in this repository. As long as you have studied *Linear Algebra* and *Calculus*, you should be fine.

The following textbooks are recommended:

* Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, by *Kevin P. Murphy*
* Foundations of Machine Learning, by *Afshin Rostamizadeh, Ameet Talwalkar, and Mehryar Mohri*
* Hands on Machine Learning, by *Aurelien Geron*

CS229 course has a very old website which includes all the notes and typed solutions for the problem sets, here is the link:

Sometime, you might want to study machine learning by following a different path:

* The machine learning course from Carnegie Mellon University: [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Etom/10701_sp11/)
* Statistical Methods for Machine Learning by *Larry Wasserman*: [Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcMnu-3wkWo&list=PLTB9VQq8WiaCBK2XrtYn5t9uuPdsNm7YE)
* Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems from Cornell Univeristy: [CS4780](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/)
