# CS229 - Machine Learning

This repository is built for me to tackle the mathematical models and algorithm implementation in Python based on machine learning course CS229 from Univeristy of Stanford.

* [Syllabus](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html)

CS229 prepares you to be a machine learning scientist capable of developing ML algorithms. Some people who don't have strong mathematical backgroup might find this course very challenging. Please, don't feel intimidated. I have typed almost all the mathematical derivations for each ML models, and put the source code in this repository. As long as you have studied *Linear Algebra* and *Calculus*, you should be fine. 

The following textbooks are recommended:

* Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, by *Kevin P. Murphy*
* Foundations of Machine Learning, by *Afshin Rostamizadeh, Ameet Talwalkar, and Mehryar Mohri*
* Hands on Machine Learning, by *Aurelien Geron*

This course has a very old website which includes all the notes and typed solutions for the problem sets, here is the link:

Sometime, you might want to study machine learning by following a different path:

* The machine learning course from Carnegie Mellon University: [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Etom/10701_sp11/)
* Statistical Methods for Machine Learning by *Larry Wasserman*: [Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcMnu-3wkWo&list=PLTB9VQq8WiaCBK2XrtYn5t9uuPdsNm7YE)
* Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems from Cornell Univeristy: [CS4780](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/)
