* [Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)


The following textbooks are recommended:

This course has a very old website which includes all the notes and typed solutions for the problem sets, here is the link:

Sometime, you might want to study machine learning by following a different path, the machine learning course from Carnegie Mellon University would be a good option:
