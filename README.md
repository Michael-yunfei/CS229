# CS229 - Machine Learning

This repository is built for me to study machine learning course CS229 from Univeristy of Stanford.

* [Syllabus](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html)
* [Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)


The following textbooks are recommended:

* Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, by *Kevin P. Murphy*
* Foundations of Machine Learning, by *Afshin Rostamizadeh, Ameet Talwalkar, and Mehryar Mohri*
* Hands on Machine Learning, by *Aurelien Geron*

This course has a very old website which includes all the notes and typed solutions for the problem sets, here is the link:

Sometime, you might want to study machine learning by following a different path:

* The machine learning course from Carnegie Mellon University: [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Etom/10701_sp11/)
* Statistical Methods for Machine Learning by *Larry Wasserman*: [Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcMnu-3wkWo&list=PLTB9VQq8WiaCBK2XrtYn5t9uuPdsNm7YE)
